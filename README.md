# Text Editor PWA

## Description

This is a simple and small text editor PWA. It is a simple text editor that allows you to create, edit, and save text files. It is a PWA, so it can be installed on your device and used offline. This project is made with the use of Service Workers and IndexedDB. Through creating this project, I learned about the integration and customization of caching and enabling offline usability of web applications. The usage of service workers increases the app's performance and allows for offline usage. The usage of IndexedDB allows for the storage of data in the browser, which can be used offline. This project is a great example of how to create a PWA.
